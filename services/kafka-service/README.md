# Kafka Service (Planned)

The **Kafka Service** is a future implementation of the Messaging API relay, replacing the file-based PHP version with a scalable Kafka backend.

## Goals
- Use **Apache Kafka** for distributed message streaming.
- Provide persistence and replay support.
- Handle higher throughput and larger agent networks.
- Expose the same REST/WebSocket API as the origin service.

## Status
ðŸš§ Not implemented yet. Planned as the next step.

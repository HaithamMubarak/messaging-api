# Kafka Service (Placeholder)

Planned replacement/augmentation of the PHP polling relay with a **Kafka-backed** messaging backbone.

## Goals
- Real-time delivery via Kafka topics per channel/tenant.
- Persistence, replay, and higher throughput.
- Agents authenticate and publish/subscribe via a gateway service.

## Status
- Skeleton Gradle project only. Implementation TBD.
